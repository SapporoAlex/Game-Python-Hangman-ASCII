<img src="https://github.com/SapporoAlex/Game-Python-Hangman-ASCII/blob/main/gameplay.jpg">

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game written in Python. The game includes various categories such as Animals, Harry Potter characters, and Programming languages and frameworks.

## Features

- Multiple categories to choose from.
- Simple text-based user interface.
- Tracks wins and losses.
- Interactive hangman graphics.

## Installation

To run this game, you'll need Python installed on your system. Follow these steps:

   cd hangman-game
   ```

3. **Usage:**
Run the game using Python:

Follow the prompts to select a category and start guessing letters. The game will display the current state of the word and track your guesses.
